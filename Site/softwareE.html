	<h1>Software</h1>
<p>
	With SafeBike, an ordinary bicycle becomes a very functional device, guaranteeing the safety and information of the user. The opportunities of the project make cycling safer and more affordable.</p>
	<p>
It measures the distance between the wheel and other objects in centimeters and shows them on a display. If the distance is too short, it signals with warning sound and light signal (stop lights start flashing). </p>
<p>
Automatically turns the lights on and off. At certain values ​​of light intensity (in the dark) they are released, and when it is light they are stopped.
</p>

<p>
	Using the readings of an infrared sensor, the wheel speed is detected and the average speed shown on the display is calculated. </p>
	<p>
Prevents misdirection of turn signals. If the wheel turns right and the left turn signal is released, it does not start, but if it turns right, it flashes until the bike turns. </p>
<p>
Prevents wheel slipping by detecting the angle of the road and showing the measure in degrees. </p>
<p>
The project consumes low amount of energy and is powered by batteries.</p>
<p>
SafeBike has low price, can be integrated on any bike and make it modern.
