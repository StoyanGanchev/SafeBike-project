	<h1>SafeBike</h1>
<p>
	Every year there are about 400 cases of road accidents with cyclists. Common causes are high speed or underestimated distance. Cycling is fast, cheap and environmentally friendly, but often dangerous. Most students go to school by bicycle, but their parents worry about their health and safety while driving in urban areas. Bicycles are used for tourism, intercity travel, sports and hiking.

	The SafeBike project aims to make cycling safe, healthy and accessible for all ages and all road conditions. <br>
SafeBike: <br>
- Shows the distance at the front and at the back of the bike in centimeters. <br>
- Shows revolutions per minute and speed per hour.<br>
- Shows the slope of the road in degrees. <br>
- Automatically controls the lights (taillights and headlights) according to brightness.<br>
- If the distance is too short, it signals with sound and light signal. <br>
- Prevents incorrect turn signal feeding. <br>
- Checks the driver for alcohol before riding. <br>
- Monitors the air temperature and warns when the road could be icy. <br>
- Charges the batteries via a solar panel. <br>
- Can be easily and quickly mounted on any bicycle.<br>
